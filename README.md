Custom Autopilot for my Dufour 4800 // Selene 

This thing sailes my boat for over 4 years now ... also 2 times across the atlantic .. there are some bugs .. but it's very custom to my boat ... 
I read the digital/analog signals since my boat does have no seatalk or whatsoever. 

If you got questions: Just open an issue: https://github.com/kuttikutt/Arduino-Autopilot-Selene/issues

This would be nice: If you use my code: Please add a comment where you got it. This wopuld be awseome and add some carma :D
